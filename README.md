# data4statsclass
A collection of data sets for statistics students.

Finding real world & interesting data is critically important to teaching statistics. However, it is also challenging and time consuming.

**This need not be the case:** Scientists (like YOU) dedicate a large part of their lives to collecting data to answer interesting questions - that’s why we got in this business.

# Please contribute your data (or other great datasets you've bumped into) to

## Fundamental stats
Some interesting questions can be answered with the foundational statistical approaches one learns in intro stats: e.g. binomial tests, goodness of fit tests, and simple linear models (t-tests, ANOVA, regression, multiple regression, logistic regression, traditional nonparametric tests). Engaging examples of these straightforward analyses can help get students motivated, and empower them to answer interesting questions early in their statistical training. **Such data sets are very valuable. PLEASE CONTRIBUTE.**

## Challenging data sets
Often, analyses do not fit simply into the analyses typically covered in an applied stats class. This can leave students feeling unmotivated (e.g. thinking "*why did I even take intro stats?*"). However, we know that the foundational concepts encountered in an intro class can be productively transferred to more complex issues.  To encourage students to explore these challenges in their first stats experience, many courses have a final project made of independent exploration of a challenging data set. In our experience, the success of this approach is quite variable, and can depend on features of the data set analyzed. 

**Share** your interesting, complex data sets here. This could include "file drawer" data, which seems interesting, but that you've never gotten around to analyzing with the detail you believe it deserves.

## How to use the data
Just go ahead and do it! Be sure to be respectful of contributor’s desires for updates and / or collaboration if stated in the readme. Feel free to “push” analyses you’re proud of as an .Rmd  that can be compiled from this directory. 

## How do I submit data?
Please submit a folder with two files. 
-	A README with a paragraph describing the motivation background knowledge (a reference or two might be useful) and details of experimental design and / or data collection + a description of spreadsheet structure (what is a row? What is a column?) and a description of each variable in the data. If you would like to hear about what has happened to your data or to be involved in a publication utilizing your data, please specific that here. 
-	A single spreadsheet containing the data. Data need not be tidy. Data need not be cleaned. Any file format will do. Munging etc is part of the challenge. Data structures whose complexity exceeds a single spreadsheet could be ok in special cases. 

## What makes a good "challenge" data set? 
-	Motivated by a clear and exciting question (or two) - "toy examples" and fishing expeditions are unlikely to facilitate student learning / mastery. 
-	Build upon the skills of “statistical thinking” learned in introductory class, for posing questions and interpreting, but cannot simply be analyzed by a sharp undergrad in one class session. 
-	Requires the learning one or two statistical approaches frequently utilized by practitioners, but rarely taught in an intro class (e.g. mixed models, dimensionality reduction etc...).

## (how) Will I know if students discover anything interesting? 
You might be curious about what students find in your "file drawer" data sets. In fact, you might want to publish these results. If either of these apply to you, please include this and your contact info in your README file and students will contact you with the results. 

## Why not use data on Dryad? 
[Dryad](https://datadryad.org/) is a fantastic resource which has been a boon to reproducibility in statistics. 
However, given the focus on reproducibility of a specific analysis, and the requirement to deposit data for nearly each paper can make navigating this resource overwhelming for statistics students and teachers (in our experience).  
That said, we know that there are great examples on dryad, and links to especially friendly data sets would be much appreciated!
